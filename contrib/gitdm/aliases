# This is the email aliases file, mapping secondary addresses onto a
# single, canonical address. It duplicates some info from .mailmap so
# if you are adding something here also consider if the .mailmap needs
# updating.
#
# If you just want to avoid gitdm complaining about author fields
# which are actually email addresses with the message:
#
#   "...is an author name, probably not what you want"
#
# you can just apply --use-mailmap to you git-log command, e.g:
#
#   git log --use-mailmap --numstat --since "last 2 years" | $GITDM
#
# however that will have the effect of squashing multiple addresses to
# a canonical address which will distort the stats of those who
# contribute in both personal and professional capacities from
# different addresses.
